Idea
----------
You are a spiritual being who has weakened and fallen to "Earth" [Players choose a starting spiritual being and get bonuses depending on
the one picked]. You land in the middle of some land where the resident monsters decide to worship you in return for protection. You
start the game as the spiritual being on top of a shabby plinth made of stacked stones and have 6 villagers to work with [race of villagers
pending]. The goal is to upgrade the plinth (and therefore the spiritual being).

Villagers initially can only build shabby buildings out of sticks, rocks, and grass. As more resources are collected, certain recipes can
be crafted to produce better items. In addition, research may be required. This in turn leads to better buildings and better tools, repeating
the cycle.

Villagers range from beastmen to goblins to ogres, each with strengths, weaknesses, and different needs. Some races prefer wooden housing while
others require stone housing due to their size or build. Some races require fruits and vegetables while others require fish or meat.

The game does not have a concept of "ages" or "eras". The game takes place in the modern era, but the spiritual being can essentially be seen
as granting intelligence and power to its worshippers. As such, there will be no artificial blockers that prevent the player from researching
or building things that are far in the tech tree. For example, it is possible to craft fine lumber even if the buildings are still made from
sticks and rocks. An example of artificial blockers would be requiring 2 buildings of a certain age in order to advance to the next age in
Age of Empires.
