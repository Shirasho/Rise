It is difficult to figure out what direction I want the project to go. There are three
directions to choose from. Each have their own pros and cons.

4X Civ Style
--------
This style would work almost exactly like Civ does. The player would start on a single
tile with the surrounding tiles exposed. The player would work the tiles in a similar
fashion, creating workers to transform nearby land into lumber camps, mills, etc. Each
unit on the map would represent a larger population (1 worker = 1000 population for example).

The problem with this direction is that the game is intended to be real time, so integrating
the desired mechanics may seem a bit janky unless designed properly. I do not have confidence
in my ability to design the systems correctly since I tend to not play turn based 4X
style games.

The benefit of this direction is that each resource is clearly defined.


Age of Empires or Starcraft Style
--------
This style would play exactly like Age of Empires I or II or Starcraft II. The player starts
with a central building and a few starting workers. Workers must constantly be assigned to
a resource in order to collect it. This was the original direction I had wanted to go when
initially creating the game.

The problem with this system is that resources may end up expended too quickly. Unlike Starcraft
and Age of Empires, each game is expected to last multiple hours. While the initial thought would
be to just increase the number of resources each resource node gives so the resource is depleted
slower, this may have impacts for how quickly players can expand. In addition, constantly uprooting
lumber camps in Age of Empires is something I find pretty annoying.

Another problem is that Age of Empires and Starcraft don't have the satisfaction or realism that
comes with building in scale. It makes no sense that 40 villagers can support an entire empire.
It makes no sense that 40 units make up an entire army. The goal I want to achieve is to start
with a handful of villagers and have the player make real impactful decisions that allow their
worker count to increase to upwards of 20,000.

The benefit of this direction is that the genre is pretty clearly defined and expectations are
well known. On the other hand, making unoriginal gameplay with a different coat of paint is not
particularly good either.


They Are Billions Style
--------

This style of gameplay would have villagers trickle in over time as long as the player has the
housing space for them. The production of production buildings would depend on how close they
are placed to their corresponding resource, and overlapping like production buildings would
cause a productivity drop in both.

These mechanics make it really easy to balance values since resources are not depleted. Workers
do not need to walk further each time they cut down a tree, and worldgen would be simpler when
it comes to advantages with other terrain.

The downside is that this system would need very serious attention to detail in multiplayer
settings.

--------
--------

Now that the systems are laid out, what can we take from them?

I believe that a combination of the latter two styles will drive the direction I wish to take.
- Players can create villagers in a central building, but only one at a time. In addition,
  workers that share a house may make children of their own. Refugees make come to your town
  from time to time in large groups.  
- Each villager will represent a single person, and each person will have traits that empower
  or weaken them. This would be in addition to any racial traits.
	- Beastmen
		- Higher strength, allowing them to carry more resources at once or cut/mine faster
		- Lower dexterity, increasing the time it takes for them to do certain tasks (textile, etc)
	- Lizardmen
		- Able to catch fish faster
		- All work slower when the temperature drops
	- Goblins
		- Reproduce quickly
		- Low intelligence (cannot perform research)
		- Low strength
	- Ogres
		- Higher strength
		- Low intelligence
- Production buildings (lumber camps) will gain benefits from being placed near more trees,
  and productivity will drop if they are too close to each other. Trees can be cut down which
  would cause a temporary drop in production, but they will be replanted automatically as long
  as the production building has at least one worker. This system will work almost exactly like
  Banished handles it.
